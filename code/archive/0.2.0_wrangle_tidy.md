# INTRODUCTION

## Hypothesis

Our study goal is to examine 2-minute high frequency heart rate variability (V1, V4) and the longitudinal relationship with anger (V2, V4) and the cross-sectional relationship with vital exhaustion and social support (V2). We expect that a low heart rate variability will correlate with increased anger, increased exhaustion, and decreased social support. In addition, we expect that an improvement over the course of follow-up in the psychosocial state of anger will result in an increased heart rate variability.

## Version control

## Libraries

Required libraries for this R project.



# INTAKE

All the files were taken from the shared ARIC drive from RSPH. They were initially in SAS format, and converted to an *dat* file. The README file has definitions of variables selected and further details.

## Visit 1 data

Demograph data from visit 1.

## HRV data

This is a complicated data set of HRV files given to us by Eric Whitsel from the ARIC group. It has HRV data from visit 1 and from visit 4.

## Outcomes data

An additional file of outcomes that were recorded (mainly death and associated ICD codes) along with if a cardiovascular event had occurred. This was updated for all patients up to the year 2015.



# TIDY

## Demographics

Creating a file that contains the basic demographic data of all patients along with their overall outcomes. The file is stored in *demo*, as a tidy tibble.



## Visit 2

### Cross-sectional covariate data

Limit the covariates to the most relevant, particularly prevalence of coronary artery disease (using myocardial ischemia or damage as the measurement). 




### Psychosocial metrics

#### HPAA

The ISEL is scored from 0-3 points per question for 16-items, with the total ranging from 0-48 points (higher being more supportive). There are subscales, which are seen below as they map on to the HPAA questions.

Variable | Questions
--- | ---
AP | 7, 10, 14, 17 
TA | 8, 9, 13, 16
BE | 4, 5, 6, 11, 18
SE | 3, 12, 15

The LSNS is scored from 0-5 points for an 10-item questionnaire (the original form), with the total ranging from 0-50 points (higher more supportive). The subscales haven't been validated.
